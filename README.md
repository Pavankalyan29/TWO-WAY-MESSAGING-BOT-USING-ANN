## ðŸ“¦ Installation
1. **Clone repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/two-way-bot.git
   cd two-way-bot
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install torch nltk flask numpy
3. **Download NLTK data:**

---

## ðŸ§  Training the Model
1. **Prepare dataset:** Update `intents.json`

2. **Train the neural network:**
   ```bash
   python train.py

- Trains for 50 epochs (default)
- Saves model to `data.pth`

## ðŸ’¬ Using the Chatbot
1. **Start the bot:**
   ```bash
   python chat.py
2. **Sample interaction:**
   ```bash
   You: What's NGIT's placement record?
   KMES_BOT: In the first outgoing batch, around 23 companies visited campus...

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Project?
### Bridging Communication Gaps in Education
Educational institutions like **Keshav Memorial Group** handle thousands of stakeholder queries dailyâ€”from students and parents to faculty and recruiters. Traditional communication methods (emails, notices, or static FAQs) are:
- Time-consuming for staff
- Frustrating for users seeking instant answers
- Limited in tracking engagement

This bot solves these challenges by:
âœ… **Automating 80%+ of routine queries** (admissions, placements, academics)<br>
âœ… **Providing 24/7 instant responses** via natural conversations<br>
âœ… **Capturing interaction analytics** to improve institutional services

### Tech-Driven Stakeholder Engagement
Unlike basic chatbots, this project:
ðŸ”¹ Uses **AI/ANN models** (not just rule-based responses) for contextual understanding<br>
ðŸ”¹ **Learns from interactions** to improve future responses<br>
ðŸ”¹ **Scalable across departments** with customizable intents
